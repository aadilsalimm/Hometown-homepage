                <h3>Boat Riding</h3>
                <p>Boat riding is one of the most interesting thing to do in Kerala.
                    You could spend a day riding the boat.
                    Make sure not to do this on noon.</p>

                <h3>Elephant Riding</h3>
                <p>Elephant is one of the best things to ride. Do not enter the forest and try to
                    ride a random elephant by your own (optional).</p>
